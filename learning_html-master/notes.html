<h1>A bit about the internet</h1>

<strong>URL</strong>

URL stands for <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em>. It contains serveral different parts, including:
<ul>
<li>the <strong>protocol</strong>: e.g. http, https, ftp</li>
<li>the <strong>host</strong>: e.g. <a href= www.facebook.com>facebook</a>  <a href= www.bbc.co.uk> bbc</a></li>
<li>the <strong>path</strong>: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95</li>

<h1>DNS</h1>

DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.

<h2><strong>Server-side vs. Client-side technologies</strong></h2>

<h3>Client-side</h3>

Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are:
<ol>
<li> HTML</li>
<li> CSS</li>
<li> Javascript</li>


<strong>Server-side</strong>

Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here.
